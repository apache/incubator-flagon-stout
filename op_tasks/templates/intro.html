Please ask the research staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.</p>

    <h4>INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE</h4>
    <p>You are invited to  to participate in a laboratory study investigating how you make sense of data and utilize user-interfaces, analytic tools, and visualizations as part of your analytic workflow. As part of this study you may be asked to engage with a variety of tasks, such as questionnaires and cognitive tests, as well as interactive tasks on a computer. The research team is conducting this study to determine whether certain types of analytic tools might change how people solve analytic problems and perform cognitive activities. This study is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>

    <h4>DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT</h4>
    <p>You have been invited to participate based on your interest or training in interpretation of data, hypothesis testing, or construction of reasoned argument such that you can complete of laboratory task and/or provide thoughtful consideration of questions regarding data analysis; Individuals younger than 18 years of age, non-US citizens, incarcerated (i.e., prisoners) individuals, or members of another legally protected population (i.e., intellectually handicapped, children, etc.) are not eligible for participation. </p>

    <h4>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Your participation in this study may involve up to 9 hours of your time. However, no single component of this study will require more than 2 consecutive hours. All study components can be completed online, at a time and place of your own designation All components will be distributed to you through an online portal that will direct you to the appropriate procedures. These components and the maximum time to complete each are listed below:</p>

    <p>Online Intake Survey: 30-60 minutes<br /> 
    Online Task(s): 90-120 minutes<br />
    Follow-Up Tasks I: 90-120 minutes<br />
    Follow-Up Tasks II: 90-120 minutes<br />
    Follow-Up Tasks III: 90-120 minutes</p>

    <p>You will be directed automatically to the  procedures we wish you to participate in You will have the option to indicate you interest for being solicited for additional study components following your first component. You may, at any time, indicate that you are NOT interested in further solicitation by submitting a request to study personnel via email or phone (see contact information at the bottom of this form). </p>

    <h4>Online Intake Questionnaire</h4>
    <p>Following study registration and consenting procedures, you will first be asked to complete questionnaires which gather information about your demographic information, education, personality, and analytic experience. This is estimated to take approximately 15-30 minutes of your time.  Questionnaires will be distributed online via a secure web-survey that is hosted through SurveyMonkey.com, a reputable company that hosts web-based surveys (or similar service) and allows for complete confidentiality through the use of sophisticated data-encryption techniques (all data submitted through services will be encrypted through secure socket encryption (SSL)). Data security and privacy statements from web-survey services will be made available to you upon request.</p>
    <p>You may access instructions regarding procedures at any point during your study component.</p>

    <h4>Online Tasks</h4>
    <p>A web-based portal will direct you through a number of tasks with interactive software that you may complete at your convenience on a computer that meets the minimum operating requirements described on the web-based portal. No single session of tasks is expected to last more than 2 hours.  You may be asked to complete cognitive assessments for pattern recognition, learning acumen, attention and fatigue prior to your online tasks with interactive software. Online tasks will ask you to engage in an analytic task, in which you will be asked to make sense of complex data/information. This task may be timed. After each task, you may be asked follow-up questionnaires pertaining to your analytic task, including your assessments of the difficulty of the task, how useful the tools you were provided to complete your task, how you arrived at your answers and how you felt while you were completing the task. </p>

    <h4>Debriefing</h4>
    <p>Following your tasks, we will tell you more about the specific aims of the research study. You may also contact study personnel with additional questions.</p>

    <h4>Follow-Up Session(s)</h4>
    <p>You may be asked if you are interested in participating in additional task-sets to complete via the web-based portal . These tasks will be identical to those you complete in your first session, with respect to procedures and time necessary to complete them (up to 2 hours). However, these sessions or task-sets may involve different analytic tasks and/or analytic tools that were not previously available for testing or were not permitted by time in your original laboratory session. You will NOT be solicited for follow-up sessions without you express permission to do so.</p>

    <h4>CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
    <p>Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data will be protected.  Your research records and recordings will be kept as confidential as possible. At no time, will you be photographed, nor will your identity be shared as part of the study. Only a code number will identify your research records. The code number will not be based on any information that could be used to identify you (for example, social security number, initials, birth date, etc.). The master list linking names to code numbers will be kept separately from the research data on a secure server that will only be accessible the Principal Investigator (Draper), engaged investigators responsible for data collection at an affiliated research site, and regulatory bodies that oversee the compliance of this study with human-subjects research procedures for the sole purpose of protecting human-subjects  (i.e., New England Institutional Review Board; Department of Defense (study sponsor)).

    <h4>RISKS AND INCONVENIENCES</h4>
    <p><b style="display:inline-block; font-family:'montserrat-bold';">Risks:</b> This study is associated with minimal risks. However, if the consent form is not read carefully, there could be a risk of not understanding fully the nature of the research being conducted, your responsibilities, and the safeguards to protect your confidentiality. Additionally, while most individuals tolerate all of the planned tasks, some may find them tedious. No procedures or materials (i.e., sensors/conductive gels/pastes) used in this study are deemed dangerous to any population.</p> 

    <p><b style="display:inline-block; font-family:'montserrat-bold';">Risk reduction:</b> To minimize any risk of not truly understanding the elements of this study, you will be provided several opportunities in which the purpose and procedures of the study will be presented, and you will be able to ask any questions and have those questions answered. Additionally, if at any time you feel uncomfortable with any study procedures you may discontinue your participation without penalty (you may be eligible to receive prorated payment or course credit). In addition, you can request to meet with our clinical psychologist on staff to discuss any stress or emotional distress you may experience related to your participation today.</p>

    <p>You will NOT be held responsible for any damages or mechanical failures that may occur to the equipment during the course of testing within the Draper Laboratory, nor will this affect your compensation.</p>

    <h4>BENEFITS</h4>
    <p>There is no direct benefit to you for participation in the study.</p>

    <h4>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Online study participants are eligible to receive monetary compensation. Compensation depends on how participants choose to participate, however, US government personnel (acting as government employees) may not be eligible to receive compensation for their participation.</p>
    <p>Members of the general public are eligible for performance-based prizes. The “general public” refers to participants that are NOT students, members of the US Government (acting as government employees), or enrolled as members of a “panel service” (such as Mechanical Turk, etc.). One (1) $250.00 prize will be issued for the best overall performance on tasks with each unique software tool. Participants will be eligible for up to 4 awards. After your initial session comprised of two tasks with one software tool, you will be able to continue your participation with additional software tools. Two performance-based prizes will be awarded yearly for each unique software tool. To be eligible, you must complete two tasks with a given software tool. Performance will be measured by a combined score incorporating: 1) the number of analysis tasks completed correctly, 2) the amount of total time taken to complete tasks. If you complete tasks will all possible software tools, your best scores on tasks for each tool will be counted, however, you will only be eligble for up to 4 awards. Safeguards are in place for ensuring that participants cannot defraud the system.</p>
    <p><b style="display:inline-block; font-family:'montserrat-bold';">Panel Service participants</b> recruited through services like Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, etc. will be compensated $15 for their participation. Again, we anticipate that participants will spend no more than 2 hours for completing all tasks.</p>
